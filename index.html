  <h1>Confession to My Crush</h1>
  <p>Hey [Crush's Name],</p>
  <p>I have something important to tell you...</p>
  <p>I've been meaning to say this for a while now, but I just couldn't find the right words.</p>
  <p>Every time I'm around you, my heart <span class="heart">‚ù§</span> starts beating faster, and I can't help but smile.</p>
  <p>I think you're amazing, and I can't stop thinking about you.</p>
  <p>Would you like to go out for dinner sometime?</p>
  <p>I hope this confession doesn't change things between us, but I had to get it off my chest.</p>
  <p>Let me know what you think!</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br>Your Secret Admirer</p>
